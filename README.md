# Neural-network based dependency parser

## Introduction
This notebook is a step by step guide on implementation of a neural-network based dependency parser via arc-standard system for transitions, and is the solution to coding sections of [Assignment #3](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/assignments/a3.pdf) of Stanford's ["CS224n: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning"](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/) course . Contents of this notebook are taken from the course materials. <br>
